## Tentative Title: *Characterizing the Subgingival Microbiome of Mothers and Babies*
Student: Irene Yang  
Email: irene.yang@emory.edu

### Overview and Motivation
My primary purpose in undertaking this project is to learn how to engage microbiome data. I am motivated by my desire to incorporate the oral microbiome in a program of research focused on improving health outcomes for maternal/newborn dyads. Learning how to work with oral microbiome data is one of the training objectives for my current K01 project investigating the subgingival microbiome and inflammation in Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) Women. 

My K01 proposal was supported by a pilot project aimed at characterizing the subgingival microbiome of NHB pregnant women and their newborns. The data analysis for the pilot is complete. However, it was outsourced and although I have the output, I did not participate in the analysis of the results. I do, however, retain the raw data that can be used to attempt a replication of the analysis. The final project for this class provides an ideal learning opportunity that will be a key step in preparing me to analyze my K01 microbiome data.

### Primary Objective
My objective is to be able to replicate the microbiome analysis output that was provided to me for my pilot study. These included addressing the following aims:  

1. Characterize the oral microbiome in health and disease in a population of at risk African American pregnant women.  
2. Characterize the oral microbiome of the infants of these mothers.

I believe that carrying out the analysis to achieve these two aims will give me the hands-on practice I need in microbiome data workflow and analysis.

### Data
The fastq and metadata files have been loaded to my github repository. I believe these are the two main sources of data that I will need for this project.

### Data Wrangling
Data wrangling for the fastq data will involve demultiplexing and sequence quality control. I plan to use the qiime2 (forked to my repository) pipeline which provides instructions on how to demultiplex and two different plug-in options for sequence quality control.
